# youtube2vidmeMigrater
A tool to migrate all videos from youtube to vidme. 

Just enter your YouTube Channel Name in the textbox and it will look for the first 100 videos of your channel [and list them in the console].

# Codebase
## youtube
This folder has a main.js file, which pulls 100 videos from the given username from youtube. I'll try to increase this number, once the tool is finished.

## vidme
This folder has a main.js file, which will push the obtained videos via url to vidme.com
